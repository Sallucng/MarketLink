## 1. Project Overview & Problem Definition
Local farmers markets connect communities with fresh, seasonal, and locally grown produce. However, shoppers often do not know in advance which farmers will attend, what inventory they will bring, or what prices will be charged. Farmers, in turn, have had no structured way to publicize weekly stock, gauge demand, or take reservations ahead of market morning.

**MarketLink** bridges this gap as an end-to-end web platform providing:
- Real-time weekly stock visibility for local growers.
- Location discovery via interactive OpenStreetMap with markers and pickup directions.
- Pre-order produce reservations for convenient in-person stall collection.
- Zero online transaction fees and no courier logistics — fully adhering to the local market ethos.

### Step-by-Step Installation:

#### 1. Clone / Extract Project:
Extract the submitted zip file or clone the repository to your local web directory:
```bash
cd MarketLink
```

#### 2. Install PHP Dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration:
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already present):
```bash
copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 4. Database Setup (Two Supported Modes):

##### Mode A: Instant SQLite (Zero-Configuration — Recommended for Fast Evaluation)
MarketLink comes configured with a self-contained SQLite database that runs immediately without configuring MySQL services:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

##### Mode B: MySQL / phpMyAdmin (XAMPP Standard)
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
3. Create a new database named `marketlink`.
4. Click **Import** and select the provided `marketlink.sql` file in the project root directory.
5. In your `.env` file, update:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=marketlink
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

#### 5. Launch the Application:
Start the local development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Open your browser and visit: **`http://localhost:8000`**

## 4. Key Architectural Assumptions (SRS Section 1.9)
1. **Pay at Pickup (No Online Payment Gateways):** Strictly per SRS Section 1.5, pre-orders reserve inventory online, and payment is settled in person with the grower at the stall.
2. **In-Person Pickup Only (No Couriers):** Customers select a pickup date and time-slot from the farmer's operating windows.
3. **Map Provider:** OpenStreetMap (via Leaflet.js) is utilized to ensure 100% reliable, zero-cost geolocation markers without API billing restrictions.
4. **Approval Gate:** Newly registered farmers cannot publish weekly inventory until an administrator grants approval from the Admin Dashboard.
