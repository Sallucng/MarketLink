## 1. Project Background & System Context (For Your AI Agent)

MarketLink (*"Farm Fresh Just a Click Away"*) is an end-to-end web platform connecting local farmers-market vendors with community customers. Customers discover which farmers will attend which markets, check weekly stock, and place pre-orders for in-person stall pickup. Farmers manage recurring weekly stock, set cutoff times, and process incoming pre-orders.

### ⚠️ STRICT SRS BOUNDARIES (Zero Scope Creep)
Your AI agent must follow these non-negotiable boundaries from SRS Section 1.5:
1. **NO Online Payment Gateways:** All orders are pre-orders. Payment is strictly settled **in person at pickup** (cash/stall payment). Do not integrate Stripe, PayPal, or card gateways.
2. **NO Delivery / Courier Logistics:** Pre-orders are strictly **pickup-only** at market stalls. No shipping addresses, couriers, or shipping fees.
3. **NO Licensing / Certification Verification:** Farmer identity/organic verification is explicitly out of scope.
4. **Approval Gate:** Farmers **cannot list stock or accept orders** until an Admin approves their registration.

## 2. Team Division & File Isolation Protocol

This project is divided between **Person 1** and **Person 2**. Both developers are using AI coding agents.  
To prevent **Git merge conflicts**, file ownership is strictly segregated:

| Domain | Owner | Managed Files / Namespaces |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Setup & Shared Migrations** | Person 1 | `database/migrations/`, `app/Models/`, base layout `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` |
| **Customer & Public Pages** | Person 1 | `app/Http/Controllers/Customer/`, `resources/views/customer/`, `resources/views/public/`, Leaflet Maps, Pre-order checkout |
| **Farmer / Vendor Portal** | **Person 2 (YOU)** | `app/Http/Controllers/Farmer/`, `resources/views/farmer/`, `routes/farmer.php` |
| **Admin Backoffice & Reports** | **Person 2 (YOU)** | `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`, `resources/views/admin/`, `routes/admin.php` |
| **Deliverables & SQL Export** | **Person 2 (YOU)** | `marketlink.sql`, `ReadMe.doc` installation guide, test credentials |

> 💡 **CRITICAL FOR YOUR AI:** Only create or edit files in your assigned directories (`app/Http/Controllers/Farmer/`, `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`, `resources/views/farmer/`, `resources/views/admin/`, and your route files). Do not modify Person 1's customer controllers or views.

## 3. Shared Database Schema Reference

Use these exact table and column names to ensure 100% interoperability with Person 1:

- **`users`:** `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `full_name`, `contact_number`, `address`, `role` (`admin`, `farmer`, `customer`), `is_active` (bool), `is_approved` (bool), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

- **`orders`:** `id`, `customer_id` (FK to users), `farmer_id` (FK to farmers), `market_id` (FK to markets), `order_status` (`placed`, `accepted`, `ready_for_pickup`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `declined`), `pickup_date`, `pickup_time_slot`, `total_amount`, `cutoff_time`, `notes`, `created_at`.
- **`order_items`:** `id`, `order_id` (FK to orders), `product_id` (FK to products), `quantity`, `unit_price`, `subtotal`.

## 5. Instructions for Your AI Agent
1. **Pull the repository** after Person 1 sets up the initial Laravel skeleton and database migrations.
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/farmer-admin-portal`.
3. Build the controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/Farmer/` and `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`.
4. Build the Blade views in `resources/views/farmer/` and `resources/views/admin/` using **Bootstrap 5** cards, tables, badges, and modals.
5. Create your routes in `routes/farmer.php` and `routes/admin.php`, then include them in `routes/web.php`.
